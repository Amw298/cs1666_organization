## Game Description

Top-Down Roguelike shooter with 8-directional movement. The player will be a slime that can absorb enemy abilities and will navigate through a procedurally generated maze to get to a boss. There will be 3 levels of the dungeon, each level getting larger and more difficult. 

## Advanced Topic Description

### Procedural Generation

Description: The procedural generation team will implement this idea to generate random maps to make each dungeon run a bit different from each other. This will make it so that the game feels more dynamic to the player.
    
### Physics Engine

Description: A physics engine which will simulate rigid body physics with friction, mass and force. There will be barrels that explode and send shrapnel that bounces off of objects and some weapons will have projectiles that bounce. In addition explosions and specific weapons will produce knockback. 

## Midterm Goals

* Fully playable, simplified first stage
* Sprites (Player + Enemies) displayed on screen
* Health system + HUD
* Base-level abilities functional

## Final Goals

* 5%: Implement absorbing mechanic
* 10%: Make a procedurally generated room
* 20%: Finish procedural generation by creating 3 full levels
* 10% 2-3 weapons and abilities and 5 enemies
* 30%: Add the rigid body simulation


## Stretch Goals

* Add in an extra character class
* Add a persistent currency for unlocks that carries over between runs
